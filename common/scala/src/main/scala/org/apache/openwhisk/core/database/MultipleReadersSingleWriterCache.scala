/**
 * A cache that allows multiple readers, but only a single writer, at
 * a time. It will make a best effort attempt to coalesce reads, but
 * does not guarantee that all overlapping reads will be coalesced.
 *
 * The cache operates by bracketing all reads and writes. A read
 * imposes a lightweight read lock, by inserting an entry into the
 * cache with State.ReadInProgress. A write does the same, with
 * State.WriteInProgress.
 *
 * On read or write completion, the value transitions to State.Cached.
 *
 * State.Initial is represented implicitly by absence from the cache.
 *
 * The handshake for cache entry state transition is:
 *
 * 1. if entry is in an agreeable state, proceed
 *      where agreeable for reads is Initial, ReadInProgress, or Cached
 *                    and the read proceeds by ensuring the entry is State.ReadInProgress
 *      and agreeable for writes is Initial or Cached
 *                    and the write proceeds by ensuring the entry is State.WriteInProgress
 *      and agreeable for deletes is Cached
 *
 * 2. if entry is not in an agreeable state, then read- or write-around the cache;
 *    for deletions, we allow the delete to proceed, and mark the entry as InvalidateWhenDone
 *    the owning reader or writer is then responsible for ensuring that the entry is invalid
 *    when that read or write completes
 *
 * 3. to swap in the new state to an existing entry, we use an AtomicReference.compareAndSet
 *
 * 4. only if the db operation completes with success, atomically set the state to Cached.
 *
 * 5. lastly, for cache invalidations that race with, we mark the entry as
 *

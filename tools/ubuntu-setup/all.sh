#  This script can be tested for validity by doing something like:
#
#  docker run -v "${OPENWHISK_HOME}:/openwhisk" ubuntu:trusty \
#    sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get -y install sudo && /openwhisk/tools/ubuntu-setup/all.sh'
#
#  ...but see the WARNING at the bottom of the script before tinkering.

# This step MUST be last when testing scripts for validity using
# Docker (as recommended above).  The reason is because the scripted restart
# of docker may actually communicates with a Docker for Mac controlling
# instance and terminate the container.  It's the last step, so it's okay,
# but nothing after this step will run in that validity test situation.

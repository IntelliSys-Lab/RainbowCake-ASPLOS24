NAME
       ffmpeg-scaler - FFmpeg video scaling and pixel format converter

DESCRIPTION
       The FFmpeg rescaler provides a high-level interface to the libswscale
       library image conversion utilities. In particular it allows one to
       perform image rescaling and pixel format conversion.

SCALER OPTIONS
       The video scaler supports the following named options.

       Options may be set by specifying -option value in the FFmpeg tools,
       with a few API-only exceptions noted below.  For programmatic use, they
       can be set explicitly in the "SwsContext" options or through the
       libavutil/opt.h API.

       sws_flags
	   Set the scaler flags. This is also used to set the scaling
	   algorithm. Only a single algorithm should be selected. Default
	   value is bicubic.

	   It accepts the following values:

	   fast_bilinear
	       Select fast bilinear scaling algorithm.

	   bilinear
	       Select bilinear scaling algorithm.

	   bicubic
	       Select bicubic scaling algorithm.

	   experimental
	       Select experimental scaling algorithm.

	   neighbor
	       Select nearest neighbor rescaling algorithm.

	   area
	       Select averaging area rescaling algorithm.

	   bicublin
	       Select bicubic scaling algorithm for the luma component,
	       bilinear for chroma components.

	   gauss
	       Select Gaussian rescaling algorithm.

	   sinc
	       Select sinc rescaling algorithm.

	   lanczos
	       Select Lanczos rescaling algorithm. The default width (alpha)
	       is 3 and can be changed by setting "param0".

	   spline
	       Select natural bicubic spline rescaling algorithm.

	   print_info
	       Enable printing/debug logging.

	   accurate_rnd
	       Enable accurate rounding.

	   full_chroma_int
	       Enable full chroma interpolation.

	   full_chroma_inp
	       Select full chroma input.

	   bitexact
	       Enable bitexact output.

       srcw (API only)
	   Set source width.

       srch (API only)
	   Set source height.

       dstw (API only)
	   Set destination width.

       dsth (API only)
	   Set destination height.

       src_format (API only)
	   Set source pixel format (must be expressed as an integer).

       dst_format (API only)
	   Set destination pixel format (must be expressed as an integer).

       src_range (boolean)
	   If value is set to 1, indicates source is full range. Default value
	   is 0, which indicates source is limited range.

       dst_range (boolean)
	   If value is set to 1, enable full range for destination. Default
	   value is 0, which enables limited range.

       param0, param1
	   Set scaling algorithm parameters. The specified values are specific
	   of some scaling algorithms and ignored by others. The specified
	   values are floating point number values.

       sws_dither
	   Set the dithering algorithm. Accepts one of the following values.
	   Default value is auto.

	   auto
	       automatic choice

	   none
	       no dithering

	   bayer
	       bayer dither

	   ed  error diffusion dither

	   a_dither
	       arithmetic dither, based using addition

	   x_dither
	       arithmetic dither, based using xor (more random/less apparent
	       patterning that a_dither).

       alphablend
	   Set the alpha blending to use when the input has alpha but the
	   output does not.  Default value is none.

	   uniform_color
	       Blend onto a uniform background color

	   checkerboard
	       Blend onto a checkerboard

	   none
	       No blending
